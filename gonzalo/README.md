Hi! I'm Gonzalo :smiley_cat:

This is my solo practice sandbox. 
I'm planning to use this for working on the Hands-On Intro to Game Programming exercises and eventually a video game prototype to pitch on the club.

Feel free to try out or read through anything I put here! And let me know if you find anything interesting :smile_cat:
