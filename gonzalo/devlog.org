#+TITLE: Gonzalo's Devlog

I'll try keeping a (public) journal of my gamedev activities (and related
stuff, like pixel art) here.
This is mainly for my own, to keep record of my journey as I learn and
create my own things, but I also hope it helps whoever reads it :)

	- <2020-03-12 jue 11:31> Worked a bit on "Bundle of 30 Language
      Games" this morning, moving game objects into an array and
      changing the title screen code to pull data from the game
      objects for drawing the game selection grid. Next time I'll work
      on refactoring ~handleGameCellClicks~ itself.
