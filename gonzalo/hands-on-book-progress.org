#+TITLE: Hands-On Intro to Game Programming progress tracking

NOTE: At the start of this document, I'm at the Game 3: Turbo Racing completion exercises
* Game 3: Turbo Racing Completion Exercises

** DONE Exercise 1, new tile types: grass and oil slick              :warmup:

   So, I went a little overboard on this one and went ahead and also redid a few more tile types:
   - Grass :: [[./turbo-racing/images/track_grass.png]]
   - Road :: [[./turbo-racing/images/track_road.png]]
   - Tree :: [[./turbo-racing/images/track_tree.png]]
   - Oil slick :: [[./turbo-racing/images/track_oil.png]]
   - Goal :: [[./turbo-racing/images/track_goal.png]]
   - Wall :: [[./turbo-racing/images/track_wall.png]] (inspired by /Zombies Ate my Neighbours/ walls)

   I used the NES palette to try and give it a retro look.

** TODO Extra: moar graphics                                          :extra:

*** DONE East/West wall tiles

	Going to need "join" tiles as well

**** DONE integrate to game code

***** DONE Fix bug with wallCornerSW

	  +Need a better understanding of [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/translate][~CanvasRenderingContext2D.translate~]]+
	  For some reason wall corners are not pointing to the cardinal point I expect them to?
	  In any case, it'll be better to draw each corner (or maybe the vertical flips) so they can connect properly.

*** DONE N/S/E/W wall join tiles

*** DONE wall side terminators
*** TODO Flag tile

*** TODO Car sprites

*** TODO road-meets-grass tiles (also trees)

** TODO Extra: implement layered track

   Create a base layer for the /ground/ tiles (grass, desert, and road, currently) and a layer on top of it where /object/ tiles exist (wall, trees, flags, oil, goal, etc.)

** TODO Extra: move wall tiles (or all tiles) into single spritesheet :extra:

** TODO Exercise 2, day/night or theme tile sets                     :warmup:

** TODO Exercise 3, basic car-to-car collision                       :practice:

** TODO Exercise 4, terrible computer controlled car               :practice:

** TODO Exercise 5, keep and show true racing time                 :practice:

** TODO Exercise 6, nitro boost                                    :practice:

** TODO Exercise 7, support multiple tracks                        :practice:

** TODO Exercise 8, ramp tiles and airborne cars                   :practice:

** TODO Exercise 9, sound effects (advanced!)                      :practice:

** TODO Exercise 10, in-game track editor GUI                      :practice:

** TODO Exercise 11, laps with checkpoints                        :challenge:

** TODO Exercise 12, collision at front and rear of car           :challenge:

** TODO Exercise 13, larger scrolling track (one player)          :challenge:

** TODO Exercise 14, better computer driver                       :challenge:

** TODO Exercise 15, weather effects (visual + steering)          :challenge:

** TODO Exercise 16, zoom camera for two player big map           :challenge:
