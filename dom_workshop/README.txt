README

This folder contains some basic code for a platformer using html canvas.
It currently functions as an infinite runner with some basic collision
and spawns one of three random elements every minute-ish.

Pulled from	a Web Development course project done in Spring 2019
by Dominick Aiudi and Wilgins Mistilen at Florida State University.
The project also involved user login and registration pages, where
users could pick the shape and color of the player character. These
features were removed to focus on the "game" aspect of the project
for practice purposes.


Vocabulary used:
Trials - a randomly generated obstacle for the player
