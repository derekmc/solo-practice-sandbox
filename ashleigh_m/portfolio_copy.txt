The client
The Assorted Animals are best described by a term of their own creation: ‘Abrasive Pop’; catchy hooks with lyrics that will kick your teeth in. The Animals combine several disparate genres of music under one banner to produce a sound that is sometimes jarring, but always fulfilling.

Their goal
get signed by an independent label
increase their fan base

* you could maybe do problem and solution...much punchier, MVP
or idea/execution
* maybe have little snippets or captions for each piece itself?

who, what, where
----------------
Client: Assorted animals, 
Target Demographic: 15-30, NYC art scene, college students
Goal: get signed by an independent label, increase their fanbase.

problem
-------
The client wanted a cohesive visual identity and marketing material 
to demonstrate to prospective labels that much of the design legwork was already done. 

solution
--------
A paper cut, collaged identity to express the band's unique fusion of 
trip-hop, pop-punk, metal. A site  content in a way that reflected the top needs of the user groups right on the home page, no further navigation required.
